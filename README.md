# diffusion-output-list

This is a list of sites that use diffusion output (AI art) from programs like
Midjourney as illustrations, banners, or otherwise as a replacement for
human-created artworks.

## Inclusion Criteria:

1. The site must use diffusion output on a public-facing page.
1. Those images must be used in a way that, hypothetically, replaces human
   artworks. This means that *writing about diffusion models*, with examples, is
   not a valid reason for inclusion on the list.

## Contributing
