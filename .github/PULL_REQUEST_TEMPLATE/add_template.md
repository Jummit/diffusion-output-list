I'd like to add these domain(s) or URL(s) to the diffusion output list.

Criteria:

- [ ] This site includes diffusion output on a public-facing page.
- [ ] These images hypothetically replace human artworks. (That is, they are not
  examples of diffusion output for the purpose of technical discussion.)

If both criteria are not fulfilled, your domain(s) or URL(s) cannot be added to
the list.

Please describe below why these criteria are fulfilled.
