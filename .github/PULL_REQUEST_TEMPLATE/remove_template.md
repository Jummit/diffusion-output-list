I'd like to remove these domain(s) or URL(s) to the diffusion output list.

Criteria:

- [ ] This site does not include diffusion output on a public-facing page.
- [ ] These images do not hypothetically replace human artworks.
    (That is, they are examples of diffusion output for the purpose of technical discussion.)

If either criterion is not fulfilled, your domain(s) or URL(s) can be removed
from the list.

Please describe below why these criteria are not fulfilled.
